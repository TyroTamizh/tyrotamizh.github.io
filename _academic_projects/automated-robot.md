### 1. The Problem
Why did you build this? (e.g., "Wanted to explore hardware-software interfacing beyond the classroom.")

### 2. Technical Implementation


* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4, HC-SR04 Sensors.
* **Logic:** Implemented a PID controller in Python for smooth turning.

### 3. Key Findings (The "Research" part)
Even if not published, treat your presentation findings as "data":
* Successfully mapped 50sqft room with 95% accuracy.
* Identified latency issues in Node-Red over 2.4GHz WiFi.
